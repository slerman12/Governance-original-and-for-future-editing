# Examples of a Plausible Universe-Endorsement

## 2016

- Such as the bird that [landed on Bernie's podium](https://youtu.be/vhezYYiTUm0?si=qVq6vOENRU2YvN3C), early 2016.
  - ...or rather, right beside the podium. And then, as the crowd of 19,000 people cheered, and Bernie began, "Now you see, this little bird doesn't know it..." the bird flew up to his podium and landed there, an arm's length away, as Bernie looked honored and speechless.
- Such as the Bald Eagle (America's national bird) that [attacked Donald Trump](https://youtu.be/j1AU4qi7tWg?si=ItrWUDXTbLLN7Yw), 3.5 months before that.
- Such as Hillary Clinton being nominated over Bernie, who won 23 out of 50 states, in 2016, and democrats being punished with Trump for 4 years<!--, not for Bernie's lack of efforts to campaign for her, both [during](https://youtu.be/aOOfwN0iYxM?si=GpT8HA5pXUgs1u1J) and [after](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/bernie-sanderss-hard-fight-for-hillary-clinton) the primaries-->.

-->

## 2020

### First state
- Such as the [Shadow corporation's app crash](https://youtu.be/9ljkWdXTx10?si=LXd_fXCDwyzQw2-i) before Pete Buttigieg [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTnM870CCu8) to have barely inched 2 delegates above Bernie in the vote that happened through that app, while Bernie, [more definitively, sinched the popular vote](https://youtu.be/swJW-bVc2es?si=pNYINRyCP4Yq0qu1), February 3, 2020. 
  - Specifically, the voting app that was used in Iowa, the first state to vote in the primaries, where polls [projected Bernie was going to win](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/iowa/), had ["bad code,"](https://youtu.be/A7WzQRXwxos?si=tjnnnbyCtalch4g8) and was built by a company literally called Shadow [with financial ties to Pete Buttigieg's campaign](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2609701/buttigieg-campaign-paid-firm-that-developed-voting-app-blamed-for-iowa-caucus-delays/). Ultimately, it was reported that Pete Buttigieg just barely won the delegate vote and Bernie Sanders won the popular vote. In my opinion, this was not orchestrated by Pete Buttigieg's campaign or the Democratic National Committee (that would be too on the nose) and is therefore a synchronicity, which the running definition I'll use here is, "meaningful, statistically implausible observation, that might be interpreted as metaphysical or, with an authentic disagreement from at least one person dismissed by many as coincidence."

<!--by my definition rooted in theorizing that the physics of nature can *cause* synchronicities, a "metaphysical phenomenon where a statistical divergence is causal or a psychological phenomenon where the meaning of a correlation is acausal."-->
 
### Second and third states

- Such as the fact that for somebody to win the popular vote in Iowa, [New Hampshire](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/11/new-hampshire-primary-results-2020-114122), [*and Nevada*](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/22/nevada-caucuses-biden-sanders-116719), as Bernie did, and not become the party nominee, was [statistically unprecedented](https://youtu.be/SknqmOfXDSI?si=67VTmYjfVix-xepM)<!--, all three first states-->.
<!--- Was that a synchronicity or the result of corruption?-->

<!--
- Such as the fact that for somebody to win the popular vote in Iowa, the first state, [and New Hampshire](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/11/new-hampshire-primary-results-2020-114122) [*and Nevada*](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/22/nevada-caucuses-biden-sanders-116719), the second and third states, as Bernie did, and not become the party nominee, was [statistically unprecedented](https://youtu.be/SknqmOfXDSI?si=67VTmYjfVix-xepM)
- Such as the fact that for somebody to win the popular vote in the first state, Iowa, and the second and third states, [New Hampshire](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/11/new-hampshire-primary-results-2020-114122) and [Nevada](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/22/nevada-caucuses-biden-sanders-116719), as Bernie did, and not become the party nominee, was [statistically unprecedented](https://youtu.be/SknqmOfXDSI?si=67VTmYjfVix-xepM)
-->

### Fourth state

- Such as the fact that Biden's [first victory in a presidential primary ever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_South_Carolina_Democratic_presidential_primary), and Biden's [first comeback victory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_South_Carolina_Democratic_presidential_primary) over Bernie, in the fourth state, marked the exact day, February 29, 2020, of the [first American reported by the CDC to die from Covid](https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=February%2029%2C%202020&text=CDC%20and%20the%20Washington%20Department,later%20died%20of%20his%20illness.). ["Biden celebrates a comeback victory in South Carolina’s Democratic primary, just as the U.S. reports what was believed to be the country’s first death from the coronavirus."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/pandemic-campaign-trump-biden/) — Washington Post. In his victory speech that day, Biden by chance announced, ["We are very much alive,"](https://youtu.be/UNqwH_3Hyds?si=A-oa2X_2TQSD4AiZ) independent from that death, as the plague, and [one of the worst history has ever seen](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues), began in America. <!--Though, that wasn't the turning point for Biden's campaign yet.-->
  - Former President Obama, without whom Joe Biden probably wouldn't have stood a chance, had called Bernie ["an Old Testament prophet,"](https://xlauren-mx.medium.com/in-a-talk-with-bernie-sanders-obama-revealed-a-lot-about-the-democratic-party-8188ea3c1cae) and had added, "Here is the thing, though. Prophets don’t get to be king." 

### Super Tuesday

- Such as the fact that, in the next vote, called "Super Tuesday," every competitive candidate to Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed him, overnight, last minute, preceding the [crucial victory](https://youtu.be/K_NT-ViVR40?si=0U4AS3OEdpH9dIVe&t=257), March 3, 2020.
  - Right up until that last-second [collusion](https://youtu.be/YWJiMZhh_zU?si=QE6fEME-a2a9YAcC)[^1], Bernie was ahead [in every national poll](https://youtu.be/DHatG_lSI2U?si=1BztfIsqPxDunZHx) and [the betting markets](https://youtu.be/iqtxkVS17to?si=ZY6Bqs4Vq-xNWGQT), by wide margins, and [of course on policy preference as well among people](https://youtu.be/5MhaqVLoqHI?si=lUE0pH3FuUKViiWe), and [in the expectations of the media](https://youtu.be/cohYnKrZ94U?si=QCRcKM4Z9f4fRLwg) ([even CNN](https://youtu.be/5AD3jKGlLjw?si=_nYcCDviPOuv08DD)), which had <!--otherwise--> always [understated him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_coverage_of_Bernie_Sanders).
  - ["Joe Biden just pulled off the biggest, fastest and most unexpected comeback in modern political history.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/joe-biden-super-tuesday-historic-comeback/index.html) [...] There was simply no reason to think any of this was possible." — CNN.
  - Each of the 2 candidates most competitive to Joe Biden dropped out 2 days before the vote <!--and last minute endorsed Biden, and Kamala, who also endorsed Biden, had dropped out first, before the state votes began. Biden's gains from the 2 turned out to [also defy polls](https://fairvote.org/three_candidates_drop_out_in_the_days_prior_to_super_tuesday_who_stands_to_benefit/).--> (Kamala had dropped out earlier). However, Elizabeth Warren, whose voters might've transferred their votes to Bernie, stayed in. [70%](https://qr.ae/pszN6o) of the votes Elizabeth Warren (whose ideology is at least 70% closer to Bernie's than Biden's) got on Super Tuesday [would've been sufficient to give Bernie Sanders the Super Tuesday victory](https://medium.com/@damonjimmyhorn/what-if-elizabeth-warren-dropped-out-before-super-tuesday-a3a7769eee10) (and the California delegates also [ended up](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811814642/sanders-wins-california-largest-super-tuesday-prize-fueled-by-latino-vote) going to Bernie, meaning [no more than 66%](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811814642/sanders-wins-california-largest-super-tuesday-prize-fueled-by-latino-vote) of her voters turning out for him would've been sufficient for that upset if my estimate/linked source is not mistaken), and, [while that ideology-based transfer of votes was far from guaranteed](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/no-warren-didnt-rob-bernie-of-the-nomination.html), winning Super Tuesday would've probably secured him the Democratic nomination (conclusively and irreversibly, and then I think [he'd have defeated Trump as well](https://youtu.be/7yMGyOU4yLI?si=xpD_TzHzk80FNvnp&t=58)).
    - Having done the [math myself](https://github.com/slerman12/Governance/blob/Ancillary/Electoral-Math.py)<!-- based on [this data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Schedule_and_results)-->:
      - For Bernie to have won the popular vote:
        - Maximum threshold: Percentage of Elizabeth Warren voters needed to have turned out for Bernie, if the rest for Biden: 64.8%.
        - Minimum threshold: Percentage of Elizabeth Warren voters needed to have turned out for Bernie: 29.5%.
        - 29.5% - 64.8% of Elizabeth Warren voters were needed to have turned out for Bernie.
<!--Elizabeth Warren dropped out immediately after.-->

### Covid

<!-- > Chapters in progress.-->

- Such as the literal global plague killing [thereafter](https://youtu.be/VzHaF30606k?si=nPbeiUarnT1oFpkI) more Americans than the American Revolution, Civil War, and WWII, including Pearl Harbor, combined[^2]. 
  - But [at least America got Biden](https://youtu.be/BhvdaK_HgbQ?si=yZ3obsrd423oIe61). Even while Trump was still sitting his final days of his term, from [March 27, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act#:~:text=The%20Coronavirus%20Aid%2C%20Relief%2C%20and,pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20States.) - January 20, 2021, the president's hand, of the coming years, both Trump's and Biden's, was forced by the pandemic to pass uncharacteristically many left-wing or Bernie-type policies, also uncharacteristically left for Biden, too, though better, as he [stood with workers](https://youtu.be/OnyQQDxFNYI?si=oQQmtBYDZ1AK6SUV) and [fought for indebted students](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/will-the-supreme-court-overturn-student-debt-relief-forgiveness-cancellation-biden.html):
    - Rapid [mass distribution of free medicine](https://youtu.be/T51a_7ljXnU?si=X0zRReRgZPKwkp4f).
    - Adaptive labor conditions and stay-at-home working.
      - These experimental working conditions appeared in time for the major advancements in AI that warn people of the kind of automation coming to American industry, that was discussed for the first time on a presidential primary debate pulpit, [via Andrew Yang, that election cycle](https://youtu.be/XbrDu8uWXCI?si=KcnZlTLXLHI4SERS), the best solutions to which, though harder to see why, were proposed by Bernie, specifically, [taking on monopolies](https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/)[^3] and, next to the usual free market jobs, a [government jobs program](https://berniesanders.com/issues/jobs-for-all/), as long as we stretch the kind of jobs humans need to be given in an automated world to include going to school, infrastructure and reconstruction, creating content, organic community gardens, and training programs, though that idealistic stretch of the idea is proposed by me actually, as opposed to the more conventionally proposed universal basic income that could keep Americans at home or glued to their screens all day<!--, zooming too deep into their noses to see the world that is being created-->, growing increasingly more socially distanced. As Bernie had said, on and off the debate stage, in 2019, ["people want to work" and the desire to "be a productive member of society" is a "very deeply ingrained feeling that people have."](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/458951-sanders-yangs-universal-basic-income-proposal-not-a-solution-to-impact-of-automation/)
        - Yang replied, ["money in our hands would 1) create hundreds of thousands of local jobs and 2) recognize and reward the nurturing work being done [...] [Bernie] also assumes that everyone wants to work for the government which isn’t true,"](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/458972-yang-fires-back-at-sanders-over-universal-basic-income/) but <!--misses my point that the government jobs program can be alongside free market jobs and that the kind of jobs that are possible, in a wealthy society with mass automated abundance, can be reimagined--><!--, to include jobs that are relatively un-coercive but further improve society, because e--><!--. Even in the age of mass automation, --><!--we are far from done building. T--><!--there will always be things to do.--> everything Yang prefers about UBI is satisfied by a universal basic jobs (UBJ) program, without the downsides, and does not require anyone to work in a universal basic job, since, just like with UBI, the free market still exists, and in good healthy competition with the government's programs, and just like with UBI, those UBJ jobs can specifically target to reward "the nurturing work being done" and other work that perhaps the free market does not find value in.
        - Providing specific goods, like organic type food, rather than money alone, is discussed further [below](#healthcare) in the context of "Make America healthy again," a Trump-associated movement that arose largely because of Covid.
    - [Giving everybody free money without means-testing](https://youtu.be/3869NqO8MUw?si=Hw-9jW-4wTxFSdCJ).
      - Thousands of poor Americans got bigger paychecks from the government than they'd ever seen in their lives, including my mom. A kind of universal basic income happened under both Trump and Biden, [also proposed by Yang on that Democratic stage](https://youtu.be/j-pJzQJJiUs?si=rbCl_kUZdZSxuivk), and which likewise would've been addressed by the [Jobs for All](https://berniesanders.com/issues/jobs-for-all/) program that Bernie proposed. A universal basic jobs program should acknowledge that childcare and good parenting are hard work, and can be one of the most important jobs, thereby funding teachers, rebuilding schools, and summer camps for kids, which require laborers.
    - Defining what "essential work" means, before the advances in AI and robotics.
      - Bernie is still in 2024 leading the way on this, most presidentially of the 2020 frontrunners, recently having written the [32-hour work week (with-no-loss-in-pay) bill](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf), which Congress [will be voting on](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1332/all-info) and which could (or rather, [by all reason should](https://youtu.be/PjJexW556Bw?si=ZgJwL2RG9m2BgEt6)) plausibly pass by 2032. The 40-hour work week was passed [in 1940](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf).
    - Not to mention [a large reduction in carbon pollution](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/emission-reductions-from-pandemic-had-unexpected-effects-on-atmosphere) [due to the pandemic, especially from automobile traffic and industry](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/1.GCP_.pdf), and Bernie's recent [Solar for All bill that passed](https://youtu.be/8hi-JpwoLi4?si=plTrjIPQ1Iuk_-SO).
  - Perhaps this forebodes that the next pandemic will be in the mass automation of industry, and in unlimited, clean energy, and that a revolution in public health with respect to medical systems, school, and food is needed.

<!--
      - For elaboration on the influence of Covid to American perceptions of the medical system and medical institutions, their practices, and my specific policies, more discussion [below](#kamala-and-democracy).
-->

<!--
### Presidency

- Bernie, not just Covid, also pushed Biden and the Democrats into making some good policy decisions:
  - Student debt repayment moratoria and, surprisingly, [cancellation](https://www.youtube.com/live/k2steBZ1JyE?si=v-YdO9nD8C3sGaOn) though [not to the extent that Bernie described in 2020](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/) nor [as Jill Stein in 2016](https://youtu.be/eKOdcxU6Clo?si=LQm7IFYPt4VPlssZ), with emails of confirmation delivered to recipients confirming their approval for the oncoming cancellation (I myself received one, confirming $20,000 of debt forgiveness, due to my having received the Pell Grant), that the Supreme Court, surprisingly, overturned ([beyond the Supreme Court's authority](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/justice-kagan-calls-student-loan-decision-overreach-blows-constitution-rcna92044), at least going by ["a strict textual interpretation of the law,"](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/will-the-supreme-court-overturn-student-debt-relief-forgiveness-cancellation-biden.html) reportedly). Notably, student debt cancellation (not just free college) was pretty radical even as recently as 2016 (same with $15 minimum wage, which [Bernie made mainstream in 2016](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/bernie-sanders-minimum-wage-party-platform-225325), [amid Democratic party opposition](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/opinion/hillary-clinton-should-just-say-yes-to-a-15-minimum-wage.html&ved=2ahUKEwi8qvae3_qGAxUJEVkFHQ_sDlAQFnoECBYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw00DW8oLmECgIVRgyvgkTMm), now [being implemented in a third of the US,](https://www.hourly.io/post/minimum-wage-by-state#:~:text=Which%20States%20Have%20a%20%2415,%2415%20per%20hour%20or%20above.&text=While%20not%20a%20state%2C%20Washington,wage%20of%20%2417%20per%20hour.) thanks to his education of the Democratic elite). And speaking of other major changes he inspired, [never have there been more progressives in the House of Representatives](https://progressives.house.gov) since his runs.
  - And probably much more.
  - Obama was wrong, as Bernie was known as the ["Amendment King"](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/24/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-was-roll-call-amendment-king-1995-2/) prior to his presidential runs, [as named by Rolling Stone in 2005](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/inside-the-horror-show-that-is-congress-177955/). 
-->

### Amendment King

  - Obama was wrong, as Bernie was named the ["Amendment King"](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/24/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-was-roll-call-amendment-king-1995-2/) by [Rolling Stone in 2005](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/inside-the-horror-show-that-is-congress-177955/). 

## Bernie and Trump

### Consciousness Dynamics

- Phonetically (and linguistically), Bernie meets the definition of "unprecedented" better than anybody, not just that the [DNC was confirmed to have conspired against him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak) becoming "presidented," but his being **(a)** [grass-roots funded](https://youtu.be/MHJIzkKLqkM?si=-P-S1n0LnNezVQDv) for his entire many-decade career and **(b)** for both of his presidential runs, **(c)** [breaking funding records](https://youtu.be/akYmB9ZX8ps?si=11YIwObmXBxvtTU_) doing so, **(d)** as a Jewish **(e)** Democratic Socialist **(f)** with his [authenticity](https://youtu.be/xP_75cANKoA?si=4XBPrbiLb2zmnyAU), [principles](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/BuNExgWGQ6SiX4PG/), [honesty](https://youtu.be/9kmv4VOGXJw?si=zOqw0cvgWZPFNKMt), [taking on the powerful](https://youtu.be/PFdgmm69BpI?si=bkI9lNUk9KIN_tQZ), [consistency](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/bernie-sanderss-interview-life-lessons/), [goal-oriented political humility](https://youtu.be/aOOfwN0iYxM?si=FpuCvykgHMS0hogI)<!--I don't like the phrasing of this-->, and [long-term track record](https://qr.ae/psqdok); and he [doesn't take his success for granted](https://youtu.be/iRMICNBXp2Q?si=k4Ew6j8J5yR9j2ti); and, in the 2020 campaign, he was 77, considered by the media as [too old](https://youtu.be/1RXSYhGJ9yw?si=qu6jWB_DaL-Y6Tal) (I'd refute that criticism even in 2032, if he's in good health), even as he was **(g)** working [harder](https://youtu.be/1a2gqS-W8Tg?si=djEUfiuGBcOgAgi0&t=23) than any other candidate on the campaign trail, [as he was](https://youtu.be/_om-x323Em0?si=GFUvAEn5YUCGtjQ0) (and [still is](https://youtu.be/O0fYQkQBOGc?si=QJ_c7Xyljn8ZFt5d&t=112)) off the campaign trail.
  - Donald Trump is sort of also unprecedented<!-- (in the literal sense, unless just losing his reelection counts)-->, but his case is different, as Nature also seems to use synchronicities to make fun of us and create farces. For example, speaking of age, out of 341.8 million Americans, our current top leading representatives in the running for the presidency as of June 28, 2024 are [an 81 year-old man undergoing cognitive decline](https://youtu.be/CAyBNzxxj2E?si=MnB8yjb889MRAUet) and [a 78 year-old charged felon](https://youtu.be/fSNMSTkeLcA?si=EMGGOK3IO7-GE15D). In contrast to Bernie's still [holding](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Bernie_Sanders) the [highest popularity of any politician in office and one of the highest of any living politicians generally](https://youtu.be/dUP-3wJ_U8s?si=5C07o_sMeIw3bAWy), both Biden and Trump are [historically unpopular](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/3wocxpkQo3nrKNcK/), in what ABC News calls ["historically unusual."](https://abcnews.go.com/538/americans-hated-candidates-biden-trump/story?id=108655435) Hindsight this time should've been 2020. But there's something else to say about Donald Trump regarding his criminality and conviction: he obeyed some laws of consciousness-physics more than other politicians and that gave Republicans their own image-apparent to Bernie Sanders. Perhaps the shared timing of two populist figures rising on both the left and the right had to do with more than just some of the shared-underlying-ordinary-causal-factors [that explain Bernie's rise](https://youtu.be/Gk_gWWar7hs?si=s66d-m7ERSQ89nqq) [and some of Trump's rise, and the scapegoating that explains Trump's rise](https://youtu.be/Gk_gWWar7hs?si=s66d-m7ERSQ89nqq), but also perhaps something not-causal-by-modern-physics-and/or-consciousness-knowledge.
    - It perhaps also highlights the poetic but distinguishing symmetry between the two populists that ["Medicare for All"](https://youtu.be/OrQXhYcYKHc?si=Z_Rh0j8nao5fL5o7) and ["Build a wall,"](https://youtu.be/Iuc5bTfAY6U?si=S986vdZn2hVS8OWH) the policy cornerstones of each respectively, linguistically rhyme, just before a pandemic. Though different in root and semantic substance, their individual spoken word [phonetic](https://qr.ae/ps363n) and [linguistic](https://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11046650/bernie-sanders-accent) similarity is another way Trump may have appeared like non-Jewish-Brooklyn-apparent of Bernie. However, the fact that the cornerstone of Bernie's platform just before the plague was about universal healthcare, paid for by billionaires, with Trump being the epitome of [tax-avoiding](https://theconversation.com/is-donald-trumps-tax-avoidance-ethical-or-honorable-4-essential-reads-196979) billionaires, is an irony that's also a synchronicity.

### Gunshot Synchronicities

  - **Updates, as of July 14, 2024**, fresh off the printing press: [Gunshots fired at Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania](https://youtu.be/QmmrgVoFq14?si=2WD-d_K56lE6J9NY). I guess "the butler did it" would’ve been too cliche for the universe’s writing, but I suppose the meaning can be interpreted as "the universe serves," meant literally, like a butler. Written in Pennsylvania, which has "pen" and "pencil" and "vain" in the name, as if the universe, or the part of it connected to Trump's consciousness, is writing Trump as a vain character. Trump had a show called Celebrity Apprentice where the catchphrase was ["You’re fired."](https://youtu.be/CHzdxly0Y9Q?si=Kj0h1t6LRes2Zqs1) In the background of the gunshot firing, supporters are holding up "You’re fired" signs, the slogan that was glorified by the former president who sat in office during the **(A.)** [peak of the unemployment crisis of the pandemic](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46554/9#:~:text=The%20unemployment%20rate%20peaked%20at,to%20February%202020%20(3.5%25).), **(B.)** [whose tax law incentivized corporate outsourcing](https://itep.org/trump-gop-tax-law-encourages-companies-to-move-jobs-offshore-and-new-tax-cuts-wont-change-that/), and **(C.)** [who additionally awarded rather than punished the outsourcing of 200,000 jobs](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/10/05/promises-made-workers-betrayed-trump-gave-425-billion-federal-contracts-corporations), resulting in a lot of <!--ordinary Americans fired-->firings. His secret service tackled him and he got up with a bloody right ear, due to the gunshot, and struck [this strong pose](https://youtu.be/fYfvSspaJtk?si=mwAfxElDYFPTuf9H). The historic fist pump (assertion) with bloody right ear was pretty cool, a look that gives another meaning to "crook" ([its original definition, "A shepherd's crook is a long and sturdy stick with a hook at one end, often with the point flared outwards, used by a shepherd to manage and sometimes catch sheep. In addition, the crook may aid in defending against attack by predators. When traversing rough terrain, a crook is an aid to balance. Shepherds may also use the long implement to part thick undergrowth (for example at the edge of a drovers' road) when searching for lost sheep or potential predators."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd%27s_crook)). The universe would probably like to cut off Trump's (politically-)right ear, so that his instincts/"hearing" would have more of Bernie's sense, perhaps. Also, this gunshot happened not long after Trump made a comment about [assassinating Liz Cheney](https://youtu.be/35LnKuKUpk8?si=HbjQYxCuSkEX0M58) or at least not long after that video was made with that title. The farce will happen no matter either Biden or Trump ([the former of whom the (mainstream) media has only recently realized is in cognitive decline](https://www.youtube.com/live/-v-8wJkmwBY?si=l-so_Zq19ZYsGl7C), while the latter, the charged felon opposed to the sitting president, has now been in a gunfight), wins. It’s ironic the signs say, "You’re fired Joe Biden," when Joe Biden is currently the sitting president and Trump is literally the fired one, both as president in the sense of losing his 2020 incumbent reelection bid and literally part of his ear in the sense of a gunshot. Meanwhile, [Biden has said he might be willing to drop out if "the Lord almighty" told him to](https://youtu.be/yz5uySyOKQ0?si=fgoMFeMQp43c6aTj), which clearly hasn't happened since that would ruin the farce[**later edit:**, or make it a more complicated, less obvious farce]. Biden also [might've confessed](https://youtu.be/zDuF_O2pI2Y?si=FF2xt9JlhwZph_MR) at the debate with Trump how his campaign [beat Medicare](https://youtu.be/ej4gFT21VOM?si=Nb-l6UgTAWEFQHA0) for All, Bernie's cornerstone policy, in 2020.
      - The assailant, [Thomas Matthew  "Crooks,"](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gunman-who-tried-to-assassinate-former-us-president-donald-trump-identified/article68402698.ece) who is alleged to have done the shooting, injuring Trump's right ear, however, is quite a nuanced point. At first glance, it would appear that the symbolism labels Trump's enemies as the "crooks." And that might be true to a nuanced extent, because the Democratic party, like the Republican party, is often funded by crooks, [big moneyed interests like banks](https://youtu.be/MTHpdjvTJcs?si=92PehhRgjMs1HEu4) and [corporate lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry or big pharma](https://berniesanders.com/issues/money-out-of-politics/). This is an important warning, and not the first time such a warning about the dual nature of the crooks (existing in both parties) is delivered. I'd first heard ["crooks of Wall Street"](https://youtu.be/7UrXK7OBBOo?si=7143YBNgWqEmvBw9) from Bernie, as he's educated Americans about this in his presidential runs and his entire career. Wall Street heavily backed Hillary Clinton's campaign, both [against Bernie Sanders](https://youtu.be/k_8jaYYdWuc?si=g9ZnBT4rthTsXint) and again later [against Trump](https://youtu.be/T2z8App14bs?si=CO4rZzU8hUEpW7xl). She even called half of Trump's supporters a ["basket of deplorables."](https://youtu.be/PCHJVE9trSM?si=x5a7U4D7AC2HD_o0) The nuanced warning is this, if this symbolism is to be interpreted: the enemy of the enemy<!-- in this case-->, such as the Trump shooter, might not be a friend.
        - And he turned out [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Matthew_Crooks#:~:text=Crooks%20had%20been%20registered%20to,comments%20from%202019%20to%202020.), though having donated broadly to a ["left-of-center"](https://www.influencewatch.org/political-party/progressive-turnout-project/) group [on Biden's inauguration day](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-shooter-thomas-crooks-donation-to-democrats-registered-republican/), a group whose website seems to mostly focus on ["mobilizing the Democratic Party and defending democracy,"](https://turnoutpac.org/who-we-are/) that is described by [Influence Watch](https://www.influencewatch.org/political-party/progressive-turnout-project/) as having the "goal of overturning Trump administration policies" and top issues including "LGBT rights, immigration, environmentalist issues, and impeachment of Republican officials." "Environmentalist" as opposed to "environmental" sort of implies they're somebody else's issues, in a crypticism that is either synchronicity, some weird linguistic phenomenon, totally accidental, or very conscious<!--, or highly sinister and mischievous-->.
      - **Update (09/16/24):** Another assassination attempt. Trump was at a golf course. He was [sad he wasn't able to finish the hole since he](https://abc7ny.com/post/trump-assassination-attempt-5-things-know-shooting-donald-trumps-golf-courses/15309475/) "was even and had a [birdie](https://youtu.be/vhezYYiTUm0?si=qVq6vOENRU2YvN3C)" at the time when they heard shots, this time ones that didn't graze his ear. <!--Yes, ["birdie."](https://youtu.be/vhezYYiTUm0?si=qVq6vOENRU2YvN3C)-->
     
## Kamala and Democracy

### Prediction

  - **Updates, as of July 21, 2024:** Biden drops out and Kamala Harris, who also ran against Bernie in 2020 and dropped out and endorsed Biden prior to Super Tuesday as well, before any state vote, is on track to be [coronated via selection by state delegates](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/opinion/kamala-harris-democrats.html) as the Democratic nominee.
      - Another synchronicity is that, of either party, the party of democracy is the one that is on track to skip a democratic vote, wherein 50% of the American presidential election choice will be decided by that party’s leaders, and the other 50% has already been nominated as Trump, leaving Democrats with effectively no voice in both the primary and presidential selection.
        - This is now more complicated than an old man undergoing cognitive decline vs. a charged felon. The Democratic party, the party whose motto for the last 4 years has been ["democracy is on the line,"](https://youtu.be/1oLASyBldIw?si=wXYSuUidmmYsHchB) is on track to nominate somebody without a democratic vote, due to increasing pressure from a disillusioned media and [political elite](https://youtu.be/8NcVFwMKUDw?si=F7WZWvxYTgUM-lJO) about Biden's cognitive decline and electoral chances. The replacement choice has never won a state in a presidential primary election, and is [also lagging behind Trump in the polls](https://youtu.be/J3iCS39SVYE?si=TZ9wCVOuwKQAXJ-3). The polls [have since improved](https://youtu.be/GohkbcaEQRg?si=sRvD-wue2xjYcJBh).
          - Now it’s ["Top Cop"](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/state/2024/08/09/kamala-harris-attorney-general-california-top-cop-law-enforcement-officer/74509793007/) (Kamala Harris was a prosecutor) vs. robber (Donald Trump is a charged felon), where the more [ACAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACAB) side is pro-cop and the more anti-ACAB side is pro-robber. 
      - And yet a bigger set of synchronicities: **(1)** In 1968, Robert F. Kennedy (father of [RFK Jr., who's been running, for the first time, in this election cycle](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-mobilize-stop-rfk-jr-cutting-biden-rcna145952)) won across the 13 primary states (back then, the Democratic party only allowed 13 states to vote, approximately the number of swing states in the general election today) and **(2)** was assassinated (paralleling the assassination attempt on Trump that quite-remarkably/implausibly grazed Trump's right ear). **(3)** Then, shortly after, still in the same year (1968), Vice President Hubert Humphrey (holding the same Vice Presidential office as Vice President Kamala Harris) was nominated by the party, though the primary elections were over and he **(4)** hadn't won a single state (same as Vice President Kamala Harris, again). Following that, **(5)** the perception of him being pro-Vietnam ([analogous](https://youtu.be/6Ei-M9JVTg8?si=iqy3Fv57Hlph2p4d) to [the Biden-Kamala stance on the ongoing war between Israel and Gaza](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/22/harris-may-not-be-the-savior-on-gaza-some-dems-want-00170420)), amid a Cold War ([analogous](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/ukraine-us-russia-gorbachev/) to ongoing [tensions with Russia](https://www.historians.org/teaching-learning/current-events-in-historical-context/ukraine-russia-conflict/)), amid [protests by young college students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention_protests) (having [repeated on a large scale around the war between Israel and Gaza recently](https://youtu.be/DM1SPHTsdyY?si=qbZ6q_PKF9HN5wmK)), combined with the perception of him being a vice president that was undemocratically coronated (["against Humphrey’s winning the nomination without entering a single primary"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey) just like Kamala is on track to be), [resulted in him losing the presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey) (as the [polling related to that issue since seems to have shown to be hurting Kamala](https://youtu.be/Htb_nNMkA7U?si=9qluUNEpToNaqvxS)), and the opponent, **(6)** Richard Nixon (who’s [analogous](https://youtu.be/52Ex7Ttj5bo?si=95R-cNBB6vMbk1Mf) to Trump in some ways), winning the presidential election. 1968 was the last time anything like this happened — almost. In 1974, Nixon had to resign in his 2nd term, and his replacement, **(7)** [who remarkably predicted then with quite accuracy Kamala's ascent path](https://youtu.be/_UCcXlSPqps?si=nVs8VO5GmOX0aQMk), was then decided based on the 25th amendment. Since 1968, such events haven't repeated and the Democratic primary elections have been reformed in many ways, including the Democratic party extending voting access from 13 states to 50 states.
        - That's a lot of sychronicities for 1968.
        - Worth noting that Bernie might ["accept your nomination!"](https://youtu.be/0ti98bgCNT0?si=w2dx4r8T6OHx2rAQ&t=47) given the choice, in case Nixon's victory was any warning.
          - And Colbert says, ["We'll get to that."](https://youtu.be/0ti98bgCNT0?si=Recyf_jsP8VaXal-&t=58)
          - Besides the [more commonly referenced memory that Hillary Clinton was polling above Trump in 2016 before the general election](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/), too, in the 2020 primary elections, Kamala [went up and then plummeted](https://www.vox.com/2019/11/20/20953284/kamala-harris-polls-2020-election) and dropped out before the first state voted. [She is doing really well now](https://youtu.be/vVpQIz1Y1f8?si=T41Yz27wJJUuxdjK), and that is a good thing that I hope will not be thwarted by the evidence that these synchronicities (and learning from history) is painting, in particular 1968. 
            - Philosophically speaking, that doesn't mean there are no predictions we can make whatsoever about the physics of the universe if all of these synchronicities aren't to be discarded as ordinary coincidence. A "good" intelligence behind the universe's erosions wouldn't intervene to cycle history arbitrarily. Good poetry often rhymes, and good stage productions often require rehearsal, but that doesn't necessitate predictiveness or cyclicality, only that those synchronicities are neither arbitrary nor unjustified (perhaps in the long-term), if their cause indeed is un-random, intelligent, and planned, as opposed to extreme coincidence.
              - **Updates, as of October 27, 2024:** The polls went way up for Kamala, and seemed to be [foretelling her victory](https://youtu.be/adOmutDMB8o?si=--HQQpH3mrXPIT3u), some in the media going so far [as to say "Trump is definitely going to lose."](https://youtu.be/5xbNxFMJibM?si=ZcOZfdMNiz2EG28g) Meanwhile, these synchronicities — the extreme parallels to 1968 in particular — make me predict Trump is going to win. Besides that, there seems to be a two-sided point by the universe about democracy, **(1)** from the Democrat [Russiagate](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/russiagate-durham-report/) media-consensus (not necessarily [independent journalists](https://youtu.be/KSwrUSdOJcQ?si=gOgErLupdmsPzFaK)) about election interference from Russia on behalf of Trump in 2016, the year when it was objectively verified the [DNC interfered in the 2016 primaries against Bernie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak), **(2)** to the 2020/2021 election, when the January 6 protests — protests, legality or morality question aside — were framed as ["antidemocratic"](https://www.lawyerscommittee.org/january-6th-was-an-attack-on-democracy-itself/) rather than simply "Trump lying with his deserving-of-criticism free speech, and his supporters expressing their emotions, protesting, or protesting violently without a protest license," which is an independent issue and actually one of the difficult tradeoffs that democracies/republics have to negotiate between free speech and democracy vs. security, with the Democratic party taking the security position under the conflated guise of taking the democracy position, in the 2020 election when the Democrats objectively [colluded against Bernie in those primaries](https://youtu.be/YWJiMZhh_zU?si=QE6fEME-a2a9YAcC), again **(3)** to nominating a candidate who didn't win a single state in any of the democratic primaries, including 2024, as a presumptive nominee, [via a Zoom call where I guess democracy literally ended up "on the line" (online),](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dnc-roll-call-of-states-2024/) rather than, for example, holding a last-minute [online democratic election](https://www.reddit.com/r/Voting/comments/1earmrr/thoughtsfeedback_on_this_especially_pertaining_to/) with voters or to at least create some illusion of caring what voters think, or nominating Bernie, the 2016 and 2020 runner-up, as the presumptive nominee, [which I think would've made more sense](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/1eavlcz/bernie_sanders_makes_more_sense_as_the/). That is a really, really big decision in our democracy made by delegates, by the "Democratic" party, the party of democracy (literally named that way), for the 3rd primary election in a row. Finally, in addition to three double-sided extremely ironic hypocrisies about democracy in a row, another unusual synchronicity is that there is an unusual amount of leftist support for Trump, and [Republican support for Kamala](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-endorsing-kamala-harris-2024/), this time around, that seems to defy logic in terms of the specific, exact reasons the former can give, and it's as though there's a consciousness situation that people sense at a super-rational level, perhaps for the reasons of **(1)** "knowing" (e.g., all the world's a stage, and us/it merely actors of it, whatever/however conscious "it" may be<!--, even though it hurts, feels like mania, and is hard to adhere to consciously--><!--, that perhaps in shouldn’t be adhered to consciously or not anyway--><!--, most likely --><!--— someten-times — --><!--stupid, unnatural, corruption-->), *but all of this I think and don't know*, **(2)** nominating a better Democratic candidate in 2028, Bernie, is possible if he'll run, which wouldn't be plausible (for any challenger, Bernie or not), if Kamala is the incumbent, **(3)** a system that is bad on the inside and looks good on the outside might be worse than a system that is bad on the inside and looks bad on the outside (and is much worse than a system that is good, as Bernie would make it, on the inside), or **(4)** the permanent symbolism of the first woman president being the undemocratically nominated vice president to an undemocratically nominated vice president. Those are the hypothesized reasons for that consciousness situation, not necessarily mine.

### Electoral College

- I would never vote for Trump. If it weren't for America's electoral college system, my vote — someone who lives in New York — would matter more (currently, [only ~13 states out of 50 matter (disproportionately)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state), similar to the aforementioned Democratic primary elections in... when else... 1968... when literally only 13 states voted in those primaries). 
  - Due to Kamala replacing Biden, only ~13 states get to really vote for the Democratic party choice this time around as well.
  - For example, I would vote for Cornel West or Jill Stein as a New York State resident, who are both running independent or third party, but my vote would get truncated in the delegate math. Meanwhile, in a swing state, I would feel threatened to vote for Kamala instead of either of those two preferred choices.

### Healthcare

- Another third party candidate who ran, and has since endorsed Trump, was RFK Jr.
    - And [my idea of including organic type food as being covered by health insurers, including Medicaid and Medicare, as well as specific implementation details](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms), precluded my knowing about RFK Jr.'s specific policy proposal of Medicaid covering [gym memberships](https://x.com/AV24org/status/1841944001210941930) and [good food](https://vinnews.com/2024/08/28/rfk-jr-proposes-radical-plan-to-fight-obesity-organic-meals-over-ozempic/).
      - I suggest a specific debit card (can be a voting ID card or other card) given without means-testing that can be used at grocers. Such a card can be the basis of paying for dietary prescriptions that doctors make, meant to pay for specific foods, so that health insurers, including Medicaid and Medicare, cover the costs, as they do with prescription pharmaceuticals. 
    - Covid spawned a lot of question on the right about the medical system, but not on the left. It is good to see concrete policy positions on this that most leftists presumably approve held by a mainstream politician. Bernie Sanders says much the same thing ahead of his time, e.g., with a [suspiciously truncated version of an interview with him on the subject](https://youtu.be/2YuizUv8LOE?si=NRb3k242QJFOp6TE), is [reliable](https://foodfix.co/bernie-sanders-vs-big-food/) on this position, down to specifying "organic type food." This is not a Trump endorsement, or a dis-world way of saying that, but Trump's inner circle, which includes RFK Jr., [seems to be unusually influenced](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/rfk-jr-suggests-hell-significant-role-agriculture-health-114831126) by some better — [smart](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/trump-endorses-electric-vehicles-elon-musk) (EVs are better than gas) and [better](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/matt-taibbi-why-republican-trump-left-wing.html) — actors this time around with the "better" principle, "Make America healthy again," sort of effectively invading among his ranks. But the word "some" needs to be emphasized. Trump, who's more moderate as a Republican policy-wise, compared to other Republicans, is most dangerous, aside from the dangers that come with free speech (but which are everybody's to push/strength-test the limits of authenticity or sincerity, or just limits for fun or out of fear, pain, etc., of), because of the Republicans he appoints. The two oldest Supreme Court members are both Republican, but it's still a significant risk. [Kamala's promise to include a Republican in her cabinet](https://youtu.be/t0F2kdGEqY8?si=4Axl6YN7GPzerZW9) and [major support of fracking](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/29/kamala-harris-cnn-interview-00176785) don't help her case against him.
   
### Changing Party Lines

- Democrats playing fire with Republicans is not new, especially as now the [former vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, who stepped down in 2016 in support of Bernie Sanders](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/28/468457319/vice-chair-of-dnc-resigns-to-support-bernie-sanders) over Hillary Clinton, Tulsi Gabbard, has endorsed Trump, citing literally a synchronicity, [that there were no new wars under Trump from 2016 - 2021](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=402846409110350), certainly not attributable to him, as her reason.

### 13

- "13" is the *8th* major synchronicity of 1968, since I didn't include it in the counting before.
  - Only 13 states were allowed to vote in the Democratic primaries in 1968, and the others weren't counted at all.
  - ~13 swing states get to disproportionately decide between Kamala and some other Democratic nominee, in the 2024 race.
  - There is a [175% increase in black women voter registration in 13 states](https://youtu.be/1EaP98vbR84?si=79f0oI29BQXHRbBz&t=342), under Kamala as the nominee. Citing as reported, [13](https://youtu.be/1EaP98vbR84?si=79f0oI29BQXHRbBz&t=342). 13 is an ominous number, but that is not ominous. That is good. 

### Podcast election

- **Updates, as of October 29, 2024:** During this ["podcast election,"](https://time.com/7099104/presidential-podcast-media-tour-donald-trump-kamala-harris/) in which most of the debates are pretty much skipped, Bernie's podcast appearances [are better](https://youtu.be/MzkgWDCucNY?si=CfVgNoaxJVlDce7u) than Kamala's. His recent appearance on Lex Fridman's podcast was a good choice.
  - To Trump's political strength, much like [Yang](https://www.youtube.com/live/cTsEzmFamZ8?si=hR7A7SrMtGUr7r5b) and [Bernie](https://youtu.be/2O-iLk1G_ng?si=ctxEuyTDsbYRm5Jp) did in 2020, has leveraged this too. Those settings are [not necessarily the most politically heated](https://youtu.be/qt977IBQ8FM?si=5IkrPzEMlmjy4Zwq), but are genuine places where trust can be earned through actual conversation with [voters](https://youtu.be/ve7ccl3YrHU?si=c5Mizd1ek7teO6SN), sometimes [somewhat controversially](https://youtu.be/W6KL1GNmo8E?si=hewIOn-nmBm6gdAT), sometimes [avoidably](https://youtu.be/qt977IBQ8FM?si=gjJWQHualR0NY6X9) (for better or worse).
  - I think this endorses the future of media as independent, where more ordinary people can participate<!--, e.g., via comments or ratings,--> and there may be less propaganda and corruption<!--, where conversations bring together vast arrays of politics and philosophies-->.
  - Together with his better politics<!-- and philosophies-->, Bernie is actively fighting to prevent Trump from winning the election, [doing his best to communicate the merits of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden](https://youtu.be/9x8zSQVkVmc?si=YXzs6sPJuE_JmiTA), [honestly](https://youtu.be/9x8zSQVkVmc?si=YXzs6sPJuE_JmiTA), [while fighting unhypocritically for democracy](https://youtu.be/PIDrUmE_zmk?si=gBFA1ezd9egDLU4u) in its true authentic state.

### Voting Reforms

- On the topic of voting reforms since 1968, the unhypocritical creation and preservation of democracy, and the [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) system being one undemocratic system that needs reform, there are also other undemocratic elements of our voting system that need urgent reform, that the party of democracy cannot unhypocritically claim to support democracy without supporting the reforms of: [overturning the "Citizens United" Supreme Court decision](https://youtu.be/o682cU2QS7E?si=BXrFxWFQFCIloVbI), transitioning to an [intelligent public funding of elections](https://berniesanders.com/issues/money-out-of-politics/), and [taking on monopolies and big moneyed interests](https://youtu.be/PIDrUmE_zmk?si=1aJzcBa_hRfcgk-U)[^3], all <!--reforms--> unprecedentedly supported and adhered to by Bernie Sanders. 
  - "[Ranked choice voting](https://youtu.be/euMd4Cgb5x8?si=7BzqNfNFmjgw-74M), [curbing gerrymandering](https://youtu.be/PGsXRSGDMPA?si=9o-DQe1Mr6UIfzxq), [abolishing the electoral college](https://youtu.be/SwrsANdOrnw?si=rzRG5qN4kQwEMrqt), public funding of elections, overturning the 'Citizens United' Supreme Court decision, portals for citizens to do their own 'lobbying' that government representatives must read and reply to, portals for referendums, right to lie, right to insult, right to plan anything that isn’t physically violent to others, right to protest, consequences-after-crime, prevention only when evidence that violence is legitimately planned, free speech, voter identification, my online election voting portal [with the specific implementation details](https://www.reddit.com/r/Voting/comments/1earmrr/thoughtsfeedback_on_this_especially_pertaining_to/)[^4] and the questions of tech therein" are all questions of democracy and the tradeoffs to it that may have to be negotiated. Most of these, Bernie served and continues to serve the purpose of educating the public about, explicitly, and <!--most of--> the rest Trump served and continues to serve the purpose of instigating the public negotiation of that discussion and pushing the boundaries that show what the risks are and what the system can handle, through his literally-morally-depraved insanity, though as Bernie described, a "smart politician" who is too "crazy," as a buffoon and a farce, but one that the average American can pay attention to, implicitly.

## The Great Depression

  - The Great Depression lasted from 3 terms of bad Republican leadership (Harding, Republican, 1921 - 1923; Coolidge, Republican, 1923 - 1929; Hoover, Republican, 1929 - 1933), due to wealth inequality, corruption, Wall Street, banks, and [a mass redistribution of wealth to the top 1%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-been-almost-a-100-years-since-the-americas-1-had-so-much-wealth-2019-02-11). Those 3 terms were the Great Depression (causally, though the correlation dates are slightly shifted forward), followed by alleviation when Franklin D. Roosevelt took into office (and who stayed in office until his death at the beginning of his 4th term). These 3 terms, 2016-2028 (perhaps truncated), are the Great Political Farce, and I think 2028 - at least 2032, should be the term(s) of President Bernie Sanders, when Bernie Sanders takes into office. And perhaps he can have approximately 4 terms.
    - Bernie was born a year before Biden, both were born during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 3rd term (Trump born in what would've been the beginning of FDR's 4th term), though Bernie is several decades younger in cognitive health and works harder based on the bills that [he writes](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1655?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Medicare+for+all+Act%22%7D&s=1&r=1), [Congressional speeches](https://youtu.be/3_M7XOiguuw?si=mkbO3Dzxl1iTZpwM) he gives, and his public [appearances](https://youtu.be/WpgkxRd6_44?si=omKQOGYMOKDgt4tD) and his own [podcast](https://youtu.be/qE5BWFRETdk?si=j6k7pSfxOXTnbk8I). Despite [championing the 32-hour work week (without loss in pay)](https://youtu.be/SodvuR7KBEY?si=hjevImjh5P9IEJjs) in his [new bill](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf), Bernie most likely works well over the standard 40-hour work week.
    - In 2032, the [32-hour work week](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf) should pass because the 40-hour work week passed in 1940, at the end of Franklin D. Roosevelt's 2nd term by the way, a year before Bernie was born. This isn't a prediction; it's a small example, in the age of AI, of something we can collectively do consciously to tell a long-form story: purposeful man-designed synchronicity, [and a reduced work week (without loss in pay) is a good idea](https://youtu.be/PjJexW556Bw?si=ZgJwL2RG9m2BgEt6), especially in the dawning age of AI automation and robotics[^3]. This kind of man-designed synchronicity is distinct from, for example, every race in Germany being made to be Aryan — blond-haired and blue-eyed — or for every official in Germany to dress in Nazi garb. The word "fascism" seems like a synchronicity to me in itself. Because while the far-right has been known to optimize a certain kind of "art" (e.g., the uniforms of the Nazi officials, all a single fashion), I think the left can actually tell beautiful stories (e.g., ["Birdie Sanders"](https://youtu.be/vhezYYiTUm0?si=qVq6vOENRU2YvN3C)), and govern in a way that actually creates art — beauty, good, not just superficial fashion — in the world. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the president who led America in defeating the Nazis, also in those 2nd, 3rd, and 4th terms. Imagine telling a policy-centric synchronistic story about Trump. You couldn't, it would devolve into sensationalism and celebrity, or villainizing this person or that (and there wouldn't be any particularly romantic synchronicities). This short essay is an example of a policy-centric long-form story in national governance, but the hero, especially when refactored in that way with synchronicities (and this is only mostly considering an 8-year period, 2016 - now, not even the rest of [his life](https://youtu.be/FynNrU76dto?si=KGE-_KRYRRrkQAuP) or all of his [track record](https://youtu.be/1Du9KdlmUrQ?si=TaufeX0hJqPPfe-X)), is Bernie.


Okay that’s all. 

## Meaning

No wait:

I think Nature’s meaning changes from symbol to symbol, depending on what the goal and conveyed message is. There are no strict rules "this means good", "this means bad." Nature achieves what Nature intends (with a big footnote answering [perhaps why suffering happens](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/Philosophy/Consciousness.md#cosmogenesis-myth)). But interpreting that message requires intelligence and wisdom.

For example, I’m someone who once had a traumatic experience involving bugs. Don’t call me bug-man, but I vowed at the end of it "Every living thing" for who I serve (or at least that’s what I meant when I was tripping on mushrooms — don’t hold me to anything).

Anyway, if a bug appeared in my apartment, I would interpret it as Nature saying, I just debugged something. 

Or I might interpret it as someone who sees bugs and thinks they’re terrible omens. It differs. It depends on what I want and what makes sense. 

## Political Manipulation via Manufactured Signs

But like, one more thing: 

In the process of explaining them, my mind sort of has found too many patterns, especially in language, for comfort, sometimes! So pattern discernment is pretty important at the risk of going insane or, "exploited" is a relevant word. With coincidences if people really read into signs, their voting opinions and stuff like that could be manipulated by bad actors.

Be wary, because when this nature of the universe is proved, politicians will exploit it.

They \*might\*, I should say — they plausibly might use manufactured "signs" to sway voters. Manufactured synchronicity for manipulation.

In order to emulate/synthesize Nature's Word.

This can only come from humans, I think.

For companies with much of their workforce automated, I would extend that allowance perhaps even to users of that tech company's products, algorithm open-sourcing, or giving the public democratic voting shares in the corporation’s policies and leaders, seeing as most people don't want the world's robots to be controlled entirely by whichever major tech directors happen to undemocratically own said robots, the existential threat of which is backed by recent [scamming](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/how-deepfake-version-of-elon-musk-became-internet-s-biggest-scammer-124081402000_1.html), [military](https://www.politico.eu/article/robots-coming-ukraine-testing-ground-ai-artificial-intelligence-powered-combat-war-russia/), and [surveillance](https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-ai-surveillance-symbiosis-in-china/#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20China%2C%20it,data%20acquired%20through%20government%20contracts.) events and the more economic threat is the monopolization of those technologies that will potentially dictate much of the functioning of our future society. The nuance of the endorsement (herein all of these synchronicities), however, suggests something more than just Andrew Yang (who I like), a vision of a future that is more idealistic, and with a long-running memory, not just pragmatic.
